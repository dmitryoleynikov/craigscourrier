                    <h2><span class="red">Sydney's</span> Express Courier</h2><br/>
                    <p>The courier industry has typically been terrible. Think about every courier experience you
                        have. You never know who is delivering your goods, or when they will be delivered. Same Day Express
                        changes this.</p>
                    <p>
                        When you place your booking with Same Day Express it uses the technology from Zoom2u. The booking
                        will automatically be dispatched to the closest courier. Once your booking is linked to a courier
                        (usually less than 5mins) you will receive a notification. You&#39;ll receive details on who the courier
                        is, their contact number (allowing you to call or SMS) and the ability to track their location. You
                        will no longer need to wonder where your courier is and how long until they arrive.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using Same Day Express will change your experience of working with a courier. We want you to
                        have an experience that leaves you wondering why all courier companies don&#39;t operate like
                        this. You can <span class="red">book online</span> or call us on <span class="red"> 02
                            9098 5100</span></p>
